I also think that the step by step process on how to lead the interaction was well done.,"The whole traning needs a reboot with stats in general, but the most distracting feature of the traning was the lack of post graduate level usage of grammar. From sentences that were gramatically incorrect to questions that were phrased in cumbersome ways, the written section of this was very difficult to make it through. It also seemed to be written from the perspective of a white male with the examples that were used and it felt excluding. Finally, while I know that this traning foucuses on recognizing suicidal risks and warnings some of the examples given could be risk factors and warnings of other problems. For example in the picutre quiz for NSSI there was a woman wearing a turtleneck in the heat. My first reaction would be to worry about domestic violence. Again, I get what the purpose is of this traning but a mention of that and any other similar situation throughout the traning should be included in an asterisk.",2019-01-28,SGMBA7,SM,1990,confident,confident,somewhat confident,somewhat confident,confident,very confident,confident,confident,confident,a little confident,somewhat confident,very confident,somewhat confident,a little confident,confident,agree,agree,strongly agree,agree,neutral,strongly agree,strongly agree,agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,1/28/19,SGMBA7,SM,1990,strongly agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,neutral,agree,strongly agree,agree,neutral,agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,agree,agree,strongly agree,agree,agree,agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,strongly disagree,strongly agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,agree,strongly agree,agree,strongly disagree,strongly agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,strongly agree,agree,agree,strongly disagree,incorrect,Not Ranked,Not Ranked,Not Ranked,Ranked First,Not Ranked,Not Ranked,Ranked Eighth,Not Ranked,Ranked Sixth,Ranked Seventh,Not Ranked,Ranked Fourth,Ranked Fifth,Not Ranked,Ranked Ninth,Ranked Third,Not Ranked,Ranked Second,correct,Not Checked,Not Checked,Checked,Not Checked,Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Checked,Not Checked,Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,incorrect,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Checked,Checked,Not Checked,correct,Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,Not Checked,incorrect,Ranked Ninth,Not Ranked,Ranked Fourth,Not Ranked,Ranked Second,Ranked Sixth,Ranked Tenth,Not Ranked,Ranked Eighth,Ranked Eleventh,Not Ranked,Ranked Seventh,Not Ranked,Ranked First,Not Ranked,Ranked Third,Ranked Sixth,Ranked Fifith,Not Ranked,moderate,If Amy has a plan and if we can involve friends in the safety plan,no,yes,yes,,2019-05-16,SGMBA7,SM,1990,35.0,,,35.0,20.0,10.0,,,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,,,,6.0,,,2.0,8.0,7.0,,,4.0,5.0,,9.0,3.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,8.0,,2.0,7.0,,10.0,,11.0,,6.0,,1.0,4.0,3.0,9.0,5.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,8.0,11.0,3.3333333333333335,2.6666666666666665,4.5,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.5,3.8333333333333335,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,3.6666666666666665,3.3333333333333335,3.6666666666666665,3.6,4.333333333333333,4.666666666666667,5.0,4.333333333333333,5.0,5.0,,3.1,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.8571428571428572,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.8571428571428572,4.5,1.0,1.0,3.25,4.5,5.0,5.0,4.833333333333333,0.6666666666666666,2.0,4.0,5.0,2.5,4.75,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,16.506,3.0,3.0,9.0,15.0,2.833,5.666,3.78,12.279,43.785,14.672,3.0,3.0,6.0,12.0,0.0,2.833,3.78,6.6129999999999995,33.285,22.008,12.0,9.0,9.0,30.0,8.499,8.499,11.34,28.338,80.346,23.842,12.0,9.0,6.0,27.0,5.666,5.666,3.78,15.112,65.954,Not Year 3
